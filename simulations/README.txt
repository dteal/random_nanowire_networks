This folder contains Python scripts that simulate or otherwise model the nanowire networks.

Each file is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html) notebook containing both code and documentation.  These may be opened with Jupyter Lab (preferred) or Jupyter Notebook (the older version) with a Python 3 kernel. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installs both Python 3 and Jupyter with required libraries with little hassle, especially on Windows.

'nanowire_simulations.ipynb' contains code that simulates a nanowire network under many different circumstances.

'nanowire_figures.ipynb' contains code that generates many plots and figures (also kept in '../plots').

'archive/' contains old notebooks that may contain code or documentation not present in the aforementioned.
